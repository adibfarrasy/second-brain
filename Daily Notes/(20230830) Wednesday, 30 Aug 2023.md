# Morning
There was some drama about notice period, the HR dashboard darwinbox stated that I have 2 month notice period, but I told flik it was only 1 month. Apparently it was input error and 1 month notice period is correct. Gave me mini heart attack ðŸ˜“


Today I plan to finish all my Slack backlog. It will be difficult, especially the dispute handover. What's there to handover anyway? everyone already modified it for partial cancellation. But it can be done, and it will be.

# Evening
There's nothing here...
