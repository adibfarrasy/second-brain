# Morning
Adib feels tired all the time nowadays... Adib don't even have that much work left in Agriaku. Adib had bad sleep schedule the past few days, but it's gradually improving, he thinks.
Regarding the morning routine, it didn't work very well for Adib. turns out Adib just wants to scroll through his phone for 30+ minutes, followed by watching Youtube for another 30+ minutes. Adib will probably consider moving his productive sessions at night (after the Chinese class is finished). For now he will just do the routines haphazardly. We'll see.

# Evening
There's nothing here...
