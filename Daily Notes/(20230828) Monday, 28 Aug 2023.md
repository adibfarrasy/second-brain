# Morning
I've just been humbled by kids on the Internet. I found out about cpu.land from fireship channel on Youtube, and discovered that a 17-year-old kid has such a massive knowledge on embeddes systems and computer science, much more than I do. Even better than that, I found this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXPiqk0-zDY&t=2, a huge software undertaking done by a (seems to be) teenager.
There's still so much I have to read on, so many projects I need to do, so many things I need to learn... the goal is still to be like pengzhihui, of course.

# Evening
There's nothing here...
