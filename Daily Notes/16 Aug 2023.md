# Morning
Still not getting used to daily journaling, I think I will at least try to write gibberish everyday.

interesting things yesterday:
- trying out clothes for wedding stuff at mbak Rere's
- interview with IHC, they offered 23jt/mo!! really a hard price to beat
- had a long catch-up call with Hilmy about IHC and other stuff

Today I will have an interview with the CEO of Flik, will use Hilmy's tactic (bringing up IHC's offer) to possibly bump my salary. I'm feeling good about Flik more so than IHC, hope it really works out.

I think I will start to do evening and morning journaling instead of 1 daily.

# Evening
I accepted the offer for Flik :) it's less money than IHC (21jt vs 23jt respectively) but no regrets. I'm a full-time employee, with startup culture, using golang, working on a greenfield project. what's not to like?
I hope I'm not looking back at this note thinking I was too naive lol
