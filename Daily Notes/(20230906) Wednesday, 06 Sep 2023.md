# Morning
I think I need a good morning routine flow, now that I'm back on some of my pet projects.
- After I wake up, I will browse the internet for 15 minutes
- After I browse the internet, I will do 1 duChinese reading and spaced repetition exercise
- After I practice Chinese, I will watch some Youtube videos
- After I watch Youtube videos, I will make and drink coffee
- After I drink coffee, I will read 1 NeetCode problem and understand the solution in Golang
- After I read 1 NeetCode problem, I will read a book for 15 minutes

# Evening
There's nothing here...
