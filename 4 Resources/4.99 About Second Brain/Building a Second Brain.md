# Knowledge Assets

What to keep in the second brain? i.e. what to write to the Inbox?

## External Knowledge

- Highlights: Insightful passages from books or articles you read.
- Quotes: Memorable passages from podcasts or audiobooks you listen to.
- Bookmarks and favorites: Links to interesting content you find on the web or favorited social media posts.
- Voice memos: Clips recorded on your mobile device as “notes to self.”
- Meeting notes: Notes you take about what was discussed during meetings or phone calls.
- Images: Photos or other images that you find inspiring or interesting.
- Takeaways: Lessons from courses, conferences, or presentations you’ve attended.

## Internal Knowledge

- Stories: Your favorite anecdotes, whether they happened to you or someone else.
- Insights: The small (and big) realizations you have.
- Memories: Experiences from your life that you don’t want to forget.
- Reflections: Personal thoughts and lessons written in a journal or diary.
- Musings: Random “shower ideas” that pop into your head.

# 12 Favorite Problems
see [[12 Prompt Questions]]

Ask yourself, _“What are the questions I’ve always been interested in?”_ This could include grand, sweeping questions like _“How can we make society fairer and more equitable?”_ as well as practical ones like _“How can I make it a habit to exercise every day?_”

- Ask people close to you what you were obsessed with as a child (often you’ll continue to be fascinated with the same things as an adult).
- Don’t worry about coming up with exactly twelve (the exact number doesn’t matter, but try to come up with at least a few).
- Don’t worry about getting the list perfect (this is just a first pass, and it will always be evolving).
- Phrase them as open-ended questions that could have multiple answers (in contrast to “yes/no” questions with only one answer).

# Ordering Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives

1. In which _project_ will this be most useful?
2. If none: In which _area_ will this be most useful?
3. If none: Which _resource_ does this belong to?
4. If none: Place in _archives_.

# Progressive Summarization

The rule of thumb to follow is that every time you “touch” a note, you should make it a little more discoverable for your future self—by adding a highlight, a heading, some bullets, or commentary.

# Hemingway Bridge

The Hemingway Bridge is a way of making each creative leap from one island to the next less dramatic and risky: you keep some energy and imagination in reserve and use it as a launchpad for the next step in your progress.

- Write down ideas for next steps: At the end of a work session, write down what you think the next steps could be for the next one.
- Write down the current status: This could include your current biggest challenge, most important open question, or future roadblocks you expect.
- Write down any details you have in mind that are likely to be forgotten once you step away: Such as details about the characters in your story, the pitfalls of the event you’re planning, or the subtle considerations of the product you’re designing.
- Write out your intention for the next work session: Set an intention for what you plan on tackling next, the problem you intend to solve, or a certain milestone you want to reach.

# Miscellaneous Notes

- Don’t make organizing your Second Brain into yet another heavy obligation. Ask yourself, _“what is the smallest, easiest step I can take that moves me in the right direction?”_
- 4 retrieval methods, in order: Search by keywords, browse notes, search by tags, and serendipity.
- When starting a project, I’ll often look at _five or six_ PARA folders just in case they contain something useful.
- Store images when possible, as it can amplify serendipity.
- Review the notes you’ve created over the past week, give them succinct titles that tell you what’s inside, and sort them into the appropriate PARA folders. Most notes apps have an “inbox” of some kind where new notes collect until they’re ready to be reviewed.
- _Intermediate Packet_: a small part of a bigger project that may be vague, sprawling or simply hard to do.
