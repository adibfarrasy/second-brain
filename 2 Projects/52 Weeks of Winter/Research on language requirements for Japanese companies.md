- I already fit a lot of the technical requirements
- AWS in very high demand -> **getting AWS certification will be worth it**

from ChatGPT:
#### Japanese
**Study Hours**: According to the Foreign Service Institute (FSI), for English speakers, reaching a Level 3 proficiency in a Category III language typically requires about 900-1100 hours of study. While this is a guideline for English speakers, your experience with Bahasa Indonesia may slightly reduce the time needed.

I will now set a goal of cumulative 1000 hours of Japanese practice by some date. This must include not only Duolingo but also supplemental exam preparations (textbook knowledge).
#### German
**Study Hours**:    
	- **A1 to A2**: Generally, each of these levels takes about 100-200 hours of study, so for A1 and A2 together, you're looking at 200-400 hours.
    - **B1 Level**: This level also typically requires about 200-250 hours of study.
    - **B2 Level**: Reaching B2 often takes a bit longer, approximately 250-300 hours, as the material and language use become more complex.
I will also set a goal of cumulative 750 hours of German practice to reach 750 hours by some date.

assume target is 1st July 2024:
At the time of writing (5 Jan), there's 177 days left before 1st of July, so I will have to do 1000/177 = 5.65 hours/ day and 750/177 = 4.24 hours/day. Wow. That feels impossible.

Conclusion: **Getting overseas jobs this year at my current language level is tough. I should strive towards getting to lower intermediate level by end of this year (31 Dec 2024)**
