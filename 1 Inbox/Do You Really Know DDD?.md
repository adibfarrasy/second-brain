- so you wanna use DDD in your project. why? if you're like how I was when I st and answers "I just wanna do things the right way", I will present you a quote by a statistician George Box "all models are wrong, but some are useful"
- is hexagonal architecture the same/ an offshoot of DDD? no, hexarch only decouples technical complexity and business complexity, it doesn't say anything about how to design/ tame the business complexity. still, it's a popular choice to pair with DDD due to its relative ease of replacing vendor technologies used within the applications without affecting the domain logic.
- is DDD the same as separating the data models into aggregates and entities? sort of, but data models are more of a byproduct of DDD (or any architectural design, really). 
- is X a thing or many things? Design homophones:  see people using the same word/s for different meanings
