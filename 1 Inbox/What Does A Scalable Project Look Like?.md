As a backend engineer, have you ever been told (or conversely, in the position of telling others) that you must tread with caution whenever you're trying to make a change in a particular feature, especially things that involve handling customers' money e.g. checkout, refund, or invoice? Does your company have that one or two "go-to guy" who knows that particular feature inside and out, and that you must always consult them if you want to contribute a change to that feature (or even just taichi)
