# push factors
- lack of freedom in backend. I don't have access to AWS, database performance insight, no longer a github author for the repo that I helped build from the ground up (webserver-v2).
- losing grip of work-life balance. juggling production issues week after week, while also having to deliver features, while also doing other ad-hoc requests, etc. I don't think I've ever had a burnout, and I don't want to risk it (though I'm sure it will get better over time.)
- lacking opportunity for growth. I want to do more things than just making APIs. I want to drive improvement projects like optimizing SQL queries, improving latencies, cost optimization, etc. I expressed my interest in core engineering work, and the responses were mild. I don't believe Mario, Rasyid and Recky ever seriously consider it.
- reduced employee benefit
