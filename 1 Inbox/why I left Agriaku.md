# push factors
- lack of freedom in backend. I don't have access to AWS, database performance insight, no longer a github author for the repo that I helped build from the ground up (webserver-v2).
- losing grip of work-life balance. juggling production issues week after week, while also having to deliver features, while also doing other ad-hoc requests, etc. I don't think I've ever had a burnout, and I don't want to risk it (though I'm sure Agriaku's process will get better over time.)
- lacking opportunity for interesting engineering challenges. I want to do more things than just making APIs. I want to drive improvement projects like optimizing SQL queries, improving latencies, cost optimization, etc. I expressed my interest in core engineering work a couple times to multiple people during 1:1s, and the responses were mild. I don't believe Mario, Rasyid and Recky ever seriously consider it.
- reduced employee benefit (no more increments every review period) and very limited career growth opportunity (strict quota on how many can get promotions, even though many of us deserve it)
# pull factors
- working on a greenfield project in the new company, building it from the ground up and have more freedom on the design and implementation of the project
- startup culture: less meetings and approval processes, more active discussions and coding
- the CEO of the new company promise that they do have work-life balance (which I believe, Agriaku in its early stage had good work-life balance too). He also mentioned that nobody does Jira the way they do (probably not intended to be, but we'll see), which implies a better process in project management.
- interesting engineering challenge and opportunities to apply my system design knowledge.
- better compensation (25% salary increase), as a mid-level engineer. I will ask for promotions in 1 year, see how it goes.
