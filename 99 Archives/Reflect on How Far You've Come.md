#todo 

Note: this project is cancelled because after some reflection, the roadmap.sh is too simplistic (what's done learning in this case?) and the breadth and depth of knowledge one must acquire for these things will take years to build. This cannot be just a simple bragging post. 

- [ ] checkmark all the learned stuff in https://roadmap.sh/backend
- [ ] prepare script for LinkedIn (it's better if it fits the narrative of some work anniversary/ end-of-year)
