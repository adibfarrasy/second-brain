## Humility

- Quick to point out the contributions of others.
- Slow to seek attention for their own.
- Share credit and emphasize team over self.
- Define success collectively rather than individually.

<aside> 💡 “A person who is not humble will not be able to be vulnerable and **build trust**, making them unable to **engage in honest conflict** and **hold others accountable**. And they’ll have a hard time **committing to decisions that don’t serve their interests**.”

</aside>

## Hunger

- Hungry people almost never have to be pushed by a manager to work harder because they are self-motivated and diligent.
- Hunger can be directed in a selfish way that is not for the good of the team but for the individual.
- It can be taken to an extreme where work becomes too important, consuming the identity of an employee and dominating their lives.

<aside> 💡 “A colleague who lacks hunger will not be willing to engage in uncomfortable conflict, hold peers accountable for their behaviors, or do whatever it takes to achieve results, choosing instead to **take an easier path**.”

</aside>

## Smart

- A person’s common sense about people. It has everything to do with the ability to be interpersonally appropriate and aware.
- Have good judgment and intuition around the subtleties of group dynamics and the impact of their words and actions.

<aside> 💡 “A person who is not smart about people will most likely create unnecessary problems in the entire teambuilding process, especially when it comes to **tactfully engaging in productive conflict** and holding people accountable for behaviors”

</aside>

## Management’s Assurances

1. Improvement is not optional.
2. Employees would have plenty of support in their development.
3. If employees decided to opt out, they would have to leave.

## The Extremes

### Humble Only: The Pawn

Pleasant, kind-hearted, unassuming people who just don’t feel a great need to get things done and don’t have the ability to build effective relationships.

### Hungry Only: The Bulldozer

Determined to get things done, but with a focus on their own interests and with no understanding or concern for how their actions impact others.

### Smart Only: The Charmer

Entertaining and likeable, but have little interest in long-term well-being of the team or their colleagues.

### Humble and Hungry, but not Smart: The Accidental Mess-Maker

Genuinely want to serve the team and are not interested in getting a disproportionate amount of attention and credit. However, their lack of understanding of how their words and actions are received by others will lead them to inadvertently create interpersonal problems on the team.

### Humble and Smart, but not Hungry: The Lovable Slacker

Adept at working and caring about colleagues. Unfortunately, they tend to do only as much as they are asked, and rarely seek to take on more work or volunteer for extra assignments.

### Hungry and Smart, but not Humble: The Skillful Politician

Cleverly ambitious and willing to work extremely hard, but only in as much as it will benefit them personally. Unfortunately, because they are so smart, skillful politicians are very adept at portraying themselves as being humble, making it hard for leaders to identify them and address their destructive behaviors.

## Humble, Hungry and Smart: The Ideal Team Player

- Little ego when it comes to needing attention or credit for contributions.
- Work with a sense of energy, passion, and personal responsibility, taking on whatever they possibly can for the good of the team.
- Say and do the right things to help teammates feel appreciated, understood, and included, even when difficult situations arise.

## Quotes

> **People-dumbness ≠ high ego** (About Nancy, the anecdotal people-dumb person) ”You know, as much of a pain in the ass she is, I wouldn’t say she’s egotistical or self-centered. It’s weird. She’s just a pain, whether she knows it or not.”

> ****************Totality**************** ”Ted, our culture is all about being humble, hungry and smart in how we interact with each other. We think that’s what creates an environment for teamwork … And we’re going to eat, drink and sleep those things. We’re going to talk about them in recruiting, interviews, company meetings, performance reviews, compensation decisions, everything.

> **What problematic employee’s good attitude like** ”I’m going to need help from someone to get better”, Nancy paused, … “But I’ll try.”

> ****************Humility**************** ”Humility isn’t thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less.”

> ****************Labeling others**************** ”dont’ assign these labels to colleagues who are truly ideal team players simply because they are _relatively_ stronger in one of the three areas.”

## Personal Comments

- The author never backs up his claim (total red flag ⛳) how do I know this thing works beyond the fictional story in the book?
- The author confides the values are simple, and they are perhaps too simple. The counterfactual conclusions of the virtues talked about are prideful, family-oriented, introverted people are not good team players (I will argue that they _can be_).
- The word “Ideal” in the “Ideal Team Player” says it all: is it practical to hire for these things? no stats no nothing? I’m not convinced. I’d rather hire based on hard skills and/or specific affinities to decide whether I want to work with them, not a one-size-fits-all, simpler-than-it-seems 3 virtues. There’s a statistic actually, [Google crunched the numbers on tens of thousands of interviews to see if there was a correlation between how high an interviewer rated the interaction and how well the candidate went on to perform. What they found was that there was “zero relationship” and that it was “a complete random mess”.](https://www.notion.so/Google-crunched-the-numbers-on-tens-of-thousands-of-interviews-to-see-if-there-was-a-correlation-bet-3ca85b838c75436687140e52761d92c9?pvs=21)
- Why is Agriaku not full of these ideal people? does it mean it doesn’t work? is the hiring process faulty?
