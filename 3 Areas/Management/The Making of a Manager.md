# A Manager‚Äôs Job is to‚Ä¶

- build a team that works well together,
- support members in reaching their career goals, and
- create processes to get work done smoothly and efficiently

> ‚ÄúWhat is the job of a soccer player?‚Äù would you say that it‚Äôs to attend practices, pass the ball to their teammates, and attempt to score goals? ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄùThe job of a soccer player is to win games‚Äù

### One line answer: _your job, as a manager, is to get better outcomes from a group of people working together_.

# Can You Be a Great Manager?

Ask yourself these 3 questions.

1. Do I find it more motivating to achieve a particular outcome or to play a specific role?
2. Do I like talking with people?
3. Can I provide stability for an emotionally challenging situation?

# Routes to Managerial Role

- **Apprentice:** Your manager‚Äôs team is growing, so you‚Äôve been asked to manage a part of it going forward.
- ************Pioneer:************ You are a founding member of a new group, and you‚Äôre now responsible for its growth.

- What are the ways in which you‚Äôd like to be supported?
- How do you like to be recognized for great work?
- What kind of feedback is most useful to you?
- Imagine that you and I had an amazing relationship. What would that look like?

# Calibrate on What‚Äôs ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù

When starting out in a new team as a manager (or maybe even as IC), ask your manager this questions

- What does it mean to do a great job versus an average or poor job? Can you give me some examples?
- Can you share your impressions of how you think Project X or Meeting Y went? Why do you think that?
- I noticed that Z happened the other day‚Ä¶ is that normal or should I be concerned?
- What keeps you up at night? Why?
- How do you determine which things to prioritize?

# Feedback

<aside> üí° Feedback, at its best, transforms people in ways they‚Äôre proud of.

</aside>

Feedback process should begin before any work does. At that point, you should agree on what success looks like - whether for a given project or for a given time period - get ahead of any expected issues, and lay the foundation for productive fedback sessions in the future.

> ‚ÄúIf the first time he hears that he‚Äôs not meeting expectations is during performance review , it‚Äôs going to feel terrible.

## Am I Giving Feedback Often Enough?

- Strive for at least 50% positive feedback so she knows what she‚Äôs doing well
- Watch out for only ever giving task-specific feedback

## Does My Feedback Lead to Positive Action?

1. Make your feedback as specific as possible.
2. Clarify what success looks and feels like.
3. Suggest next steps.

## Critical Feedback Template

‚ÄúWhen I _[heard/observed/reflected on]_ ~~~~~~your _[action/ behavior/ output]_, I felt concerned because ‚Ä¶‚Äù~~

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to understand your perspective and talk about how we can resolve this.‚Äù

## Acknowledge Disagreement Template

‚ÄúI recognize that you may not agree with my decision, but I‚Äôm asking for your cooperation in moving forward.‚Äù

# How to Lead

## Understand Your Strengths

- How would the people who know and like me best (family, significant other, close friends) describe me in three words?
- What three qualities do I possess that I am the proudest of?
- When I look back on something I did that was successful, what personal traits do I give credit to?
- What are the top three most common pieces of positive feedback that I‚Äôve received from my managers or peers?

## Understand Your Weaknesses

- Whenever my worst inner critic sits on my shoulder, what does she yell at me for?
- If a magical fairy were to come and bestow on me three gifts I don‚Äôt yet have, what would they be?
- What are three things that trigger me?
- What are the top three most common pieces of feedback from my manager or peers on how I could be more effective?

# Meetings

A great informational meeting accomplishes the following:

- Enables the group to feel like they learned something valuable
- Conveys key messages clearly and memorably
- Keeps the audience‚Äôs attention (through dynamic speakers, rich storytelling, skilled pacing, interactivity)
- Evokes an intended emotion - whether inspiration, trust, pride, courage, empathy, etc.

A great feedback meeting accomplishes the following:

- Gets everyone on the same page about what success for the project looks like
- Honestly represents the current status of the work, including an assessment of how things are going, any changes since the last check-in, and what the future plans are.
- Clearly frames open questions, key decisions, or known concerns to get the most helpful feedback
- Ends with agreed-upon next steps (including when the next milestone or check-in will be)

# Designing a Team

Once a year, create a future org chart, analyze gaps in skills, strengths, or experiences, and make a list of open roles to hire for.

Ask the following questions:

- How many new people will I add to our team this year (based on company growth, expected attrition, budget, priorities, etc.)?
    
- For each new hire, what level of experience am I looking for?
    
- Which specific skills or strengths do we need in our team (for example, creative thinking, opeartional excellence, expertise in XYZ, etc.)?
    
- Which skills and strengths does our team already have that new hires can stand to be weaker in?
    
- What traits, past experiences, or personalities would strengthen the diversity of our team?
    
## Hiring
> ![Info] 
> Google crunched the numbers on tens of thousands of interviews to see if there was a correlation between how high an interviewer rated the interaction and how well the candidate went on to perform. What they found was that there was ‚Äúzero relationship‚Äù and that it was ‚Äúa complete random mess‚Äù.

- Since every hire is already a gamble, reject any weak hires. While they‚Äôre not likely to bomb, they‚Äòre also not likely to add much.
- Hiring questions:
	1. What kinds of challenges are interesting to you and why? Can you describe a favorite project?
	2. What do you consider your greatest strengths? What would your peers agree are your areas of growth?
	3. Imagine yourself in three years. What do you hope will be different about you then compared to now?
	4. What was the hardest conflict you‚Äôve had in the past year? How did it end, and what did you learn from the experience?
	5. What‚Äôs something that inspired you in your work recently?
- Reject anyone who exhibits toxic behavior.
- a 2014 report of hundreds of public companies found that those with the greatest ethnic and racial diversity in their management ranks were 35% more likely to have financial returns higher than average.
- If, for your team, one accept comes from two offers, eight interviews, twenty initial meetings, and forty emails, then to get twenty hires, you‚Äôll need to send about 800 emails over the course of the year. (this is the funnel framework)
- If your team is growing to the point of needing more managers, the responsibility of hiring must become shared. Eventually, you won‚Äôt be in every interview, nor be the deciding vote in every debrief.

    ## Firing

    ## Know the Kind of Team You Want to Be a Part of
    
    Understanding your current team:
    
    - What are the first three adjectives that come to mind when describing the personality of your team?
    - What moments made you feel most proud to be a part of your team? Why?
    - What does your team do better than the majority of other teams out there?
    - If you picked five random members of your team and individually asked each person, ‚ÄúWhat does our team value?‚Äù what would you hear?
    - How similar is your team‚Äôs culture to the broader organization‚Äôs culture?
    - Imagine a journalist scrutinizing your team. What would she say your team does well or not well?
    - When people complain about how things work, what are the top three things that they bring up?
    
    Understanding your aspirations:
    
    - Describe the top five adjectives you‚Äôd want an external observer to use to describe your team‚Äôs culture. Why those?
    - Now imagine those five adjectives sitting on a double-edged sword. What do you imagine are the pitfalls that come from ruthless adherence to those qualities? Are those acceptable to you?
    - Make a list of the aspects of culture that you admire about other teams or organizations. Why do you admire them? What downsides does that team tolerate as a result?
    - Make a list of the aspects of culture that you wouldn‚Äôt want to emulate from other teams or companies. Why not?
    
    Understanding the difference:
    
    - On a scale from one to nine, with nine being ‚Äúwe‚Äôre 100% there‚Äù and one being ‚Äúthis is the opposite of our team‚Äù, how close is your current team to your aspirations?
    - What shows up as both a strength of your team as well as a quality you value highly?
    - Where are the biggest gaps between tyour current team culture and your aspirations?
    - What are the obstacles that might get in the way of reaching your aspirations? How willl you address them?
    - Imagine how you want your team to work in a year‚Äôs time. How would you describe to a report what you hope will be different then compared to now?

# Characteristics of a Good Team

- List of projects or tasks are prioritized from most to least important, with the higher-up items receiving more time and attention.
- There is an efficient process for decision-making that everyone understands and trusts.
- The team moves quickly, especially with reversible decisions.
- After a decision is made, everyone commits (even those who disagree) and moves speedily to make it happen. Without new information, there is no second-guessing the decision, no pocket vetoing, and no foot dragging.
- When important new information surfaces, there is an expedient process to examine if and how current plans should change as a result.
- Every task has a _who_ and a _by when._ Owners set and reliably deliver on commitments.
- The team is resilient and constantly seeking to learn. Every failure makes the team stronger because they don‚Äôt make the same mistake twice.
- **Never stop talking about what‚Äôs important**. talking about your values make you a more authentic and inspiring leader.
- Common incentive traps to avoid:
    - Rewarding individual performance over anything else
    - Rewarding short-term gains over long-term investments
    - Rewarding lack of perceived issues or conflict
    - Rewarding the squeaky wheel. (trying to retain leaving reports)
- Do hackatons
- Pay attention to your own actions - the little things you say and do - as well as what behaviors you are rewarding or discouraging

# Miscellaneous

- The first big part of your job as a manager is to ensure that your team knows what success looks like and cares about achieving it.
- You have to enjoy the day-to-day of management and _want to do it_.
- The best outcomes come from inspiring people to action, not _telling_ them what to do.
- A useful exercise to go through at the beginning of your transition is to sit down and make a list of all the things that are awesome about the current state of the world. Now, next to that, create a list of all the things that could be better.
- When joining a new team as a manager, first calibrate your expectations on what‚Äôs normal.
- It‚Äôs easy to like and have a great relationship with someone who is kicking ass. The harder test is, what happens if she struggles?
- There is a certain archetype of the brilliant lone wolf who, though he regularly puts others down, manages to come out the hero because he is simply heads and tails more capable than anyone else. The presence of this person makes the less of your team less effective.
- Remember to ask for both task-specific and behavioral feedback.
- If you get the opportunity to get formal training, take it.
- Ask meeting organizers to send out any presentations or documents the day before so that everyone got the chance to process the infromation in advance.
- Though it‚Äôs common to hear the words like _help_, _improve_, or _enhance_ when talking about goals, they don‚Äôt paint a clear picture.
- At higher levels of management, the job starts to converge regardless of background. Success becomes more and more about mastering a few key skills; hiring exceptional leaders, building self-reliant reams, establishing a clear vision, and communicating well.
- 1:1s aren‚Äôt for the manager‚Äôs benefit; they should be about what‚Äôs helpful for the other person.
- Attend industry events and speak at conferences to attract people to the team.
